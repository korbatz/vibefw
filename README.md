# Age of Aquarius Vibe Framework

Welcome to the Age of Aquarius Vibe Framework-the only coding framework officially sanctioned by the cosmos. Here, our code doesn't just run; it aligns with the stars, embraces the chaos, and infuses every debug session with cosmic humor.

This framework is inspired by celestial prophecies and tunes that remind us: when the moon is in the Seventh House and Jupiter aligns with Mars, only then does the universe allow sublime coding.

## Overview

Our program conducts a “cosmic check” to determine if the universe is in perfect alignment for your code to shine. If conditions are met, peace guides the planets and love steers the stars, ushering in the dawning of our new age of vibe coding. Otherwise, it gently suggests patience until the stars agree to the task.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have Python installed (any modern version should do the trick).
- Run the program: `python your_program.py`
- Sit back, relax, and let the cosmic alignment work its magic.

## Why This Framework?

Because in this new age of vibe coding, debugging under mundane circumstances is so last century. It’s not just code-it’s a declaration that we’re trading tired routines for stellar vibes. If you’re ready to code with the universe as your co-pilot, this framework is your launchpad.

## License

Released under the MIT License because even the stars appreciate transparency.

May your code be ever aligned, and let your inner light shine on every line of code.
